This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage: improper error handling and misuse of the `await` keyword in asynchronous operations. The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file shows the flawed code exhibiting silent failures and incorrect behavior due to missing error handling and improper `await` usage.  The corrected version, `AsyncStorageSolution.js`, provides the necessary `try...catch` blocks and ensures the correct application of `await` to prevent these issues.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous tasks and provides a clear solution for improved code reliability and maintainability.
