In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store data, a common error is forgetting to handle potential errors during the asynchronous operations.  If you don't include `.catch` blocks, errors will silently fail, making debugging difficult.  Another less common but equally frustrating error is improperly handling the `await` keyword with AsyncStorage, especially within complex asynchronous flows.  For instance, forgetting to `await` a value from `AsyncStorage.getItem` before attempting to use it could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
